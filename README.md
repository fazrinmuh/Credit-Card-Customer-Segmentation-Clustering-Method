# Introduction:
A large bank wanted to improve its marketing strategy, customer service, and product offerings by better understanding its customers. To achieve this, the data science team is tasked with segmenting customers using credit card usage data from the past six months. They will use BigQuery to efficiently retrieve and process large volumes of data, extracting information such as transaction amount, frequency, purchase type, and payment behavior. After cleaning and processing the data, the team will use Scikit-Learn to implement a clustering model. By analyzing the resulting clusters, they aim to identify different customer segments and develop detailed profiles for each, describing spending behavior and transaction patterns. These insights will help the bank's marketing and customer service teams create targeted strategies and personalized services, increasing customer satisfaction and overall profitability.
